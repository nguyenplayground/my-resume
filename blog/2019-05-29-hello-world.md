You should not work hard when you think it's thing take for granted and shouldn't be proud about. 

You should not work hard if you have something more important to work on. 

You should not work hard if you gonna reget about it later. 

You should not work hard if it's make your health get worse. 

You should not work hard if it's make you feel miserable and anxiety. 

You should not work hard if tomorrow is apocalypse

You should not work hard if your boss is a naracisst and try to bully you
